      <h2>About</h2>
        <p> PLACEHOLDER I live and work near Cleveland, Ohio. At my day job, I develop WordPress websites and cross-platform mobile apps. I also freelance when I can, mostly building custom websites and apps that you can’t get from a template.

            My place in the world seems to be at the intersection of creativity and logic. All projects are a problem to be solved, whether it’s to do with design or code—only the tools change. My process is iterative; I approach each problem as a learning experience that informs the rest of the project, which means that I tend to not rely on full design mockups. Most of the time, I do a few sketches to flesh out a concept, and immediately dive into a working prototype that is much more flexible than jumping back and forth between code and Photoshop.
            
            My formal art & design training taught me to carefully consider my audience and what experience I intend for them to have through my work. Who is visiting your site? What are they looking for? How do they find it? What analytics are available to base our decisions on?
            
            While my focus is mobile-first responsive websites with HTML, JavaScript,  SASS, PHP, and MySQL (often on top of WordPress or Drupal), I also do bash scripting and linux server administration. I’ve also worked with Java/Android Studio, Objective-C/Xcode, ActionScript3/Flash (and Haxe), and C#/Unity3D.
            
            I am always experimenting, always learning, and never bored. PLACEHOLDER</p>
